Title:        C# 494 - Midterm
Author:		  Erick Tenorio
Course:		  COMP 494
Due Date:	  March 22, 2021
Environment:  Visual C#

Objective:  Enhance the Calculator class to include two new methods,
            the Mean (Average) method and Median (middle) method.
            
            After enhancing the Calculator class, create a console
            application to read an input file from the directory. Read
            the numbers from the input file to perform calculations for
            the mean and median.
            
            Write the results to an output file in the same directory
            as the input file. Format the output to make it readable
            and meaningful.
